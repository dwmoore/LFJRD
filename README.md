LFJRD - Looking For Junior Rails Dev
====================================

LFJRD is a personal project I began to help myself and other new Rails
developers to showcase their work to the tech community and track their efforts
to improve their development skills. It was built mostly over the course of a
week leading up to RailsConf 2015.

V1 Features
-----------

Visitors can view featured profiles, regular profiles, register a user account, sign in, and sign up for a newsletter. Once registered, users can create and update their user profile.

Upcoming V2 Features
-----------

1. Add Update model to track continued learning.
2. Add Carrierwave for user uploads for avatar and background images.
3. Cache Gravitar images locally.
4. Hook up Notify.js to flash messages.
5. Add more tracking to Keen.io

Problems?

Open an issue on the repo and I'll add it to my backlog.
